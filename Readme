Controlling the installer

Agent and bundle pool
===========================================================
The bundle pool location(s) are controlled by by 2 entities: agent and bundle pool
Each agent can contain multiple bundle pools.  
An agent is defined by specifying a directory. When an agent is defined its default bundle pool 
is set to the [pool] subdirectory of the agent's directory

The list of available agents is persisted in %userhome%\.eclipse\org.eclipse.oomph.p2\agents.info file 
Each available agent is a line containing the path to the agents directory
The following listing of agents.info contains 2 agents

-----------------------------------------
O:\work\oomph\test\ganz\tool\eclipse\.p2
O:\work\tool\eclipse\.p2
-----------------------------------------

The currently selected agent is and pool are persisted in the %userhome%\.eclipse\org.eclipse.oomph.p2\defaults.info
The listing of defaults.info contains the
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
org.eclipse.oomph.setup.ui=O\:\\work\\oomph\\test\\_ganz\\tool\\eclipse\\p2\\pool
org.eclipse.oomph.setup.ui\:agent=O\:\\work\\oomph\\test\\_ganz\\tool\\eclipse\\p2
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

org.eclipse.oomph.setup.ui\:agent setting specifies the agent that will be displayed in the installer ui 
and used if the user does not define a new agent
org.eclipse.oomph.setup.ui specifies the bundle pool directory that will be displayed in the installer ui 
and used unless the user defines a new agent

If the defaults.info file is missing the installer will fall back to its internal default values

Eclipse installation folder
===========================================================
O:\Users\Bogdan\.eclipse\org.eclipse.oomph.setup.installer\installRoot.txt
Where is setting coming from and where is located
It is saved in the following file
O:\Users\Bogdan\.eclipse\org.eclipse.oomph.setup\setups\user.setup
